  abstract = "Adolescents are highly influenced by their peers within their
              social networks. This social influence can stem from both
              unsolicited peer pressure and the active search for guidance.
              While extensive research examined the mechanisms of peer
              pressure, little is known about who adolescents prefer as a
              source of information. To address this gap, we conducted two
              independent studies using a novel social search paradigm that
              allows participants to choose which social sources they wish to
              observe. In both studies, adolescents demonstrated a preference
              for their friends over non-friends, as well as for peers who were
              perceived as trustworthy. Across both studies, we found mixed
              evidence for the role of perceived popularity as a selection
              criterion. Notable, study 2 revealed the significance of
              ``cool'', ``admirable'' and ``acting mean'' as additional
              characteristics of preferred peers, traits that are often
              associated with elevated peer status. It also revealed an
              interest for peers perceived as being smart. These findings
              highlight the active role adolescents have in choosing social
              sources and emphasize the importance of multiple peer
              characteristics. Future research should investigate whether
              adolescents' interest in these types of peers is contingent upon
              specific social contexts, age groups, and peer cultures.",

  abstract = "Social information use is widespread in the animal kingdom,
              helping individuals rapidly acquire useful knowledge and adjust
              to novel circumstances. In humans, the highly interconnected
              world provides ample opportunities to benefit from social
              information but also requires navigating complex social
              environments with people holding disparate or conflicting views.
              It is, however, still largely unclear how people integrate
              information from multiple social sources that (dis)agree with
              them, and among each other. We address this issue in three steps.
              First, we present a judgement task in which participants could
              adjust their judgements after observing the judgements of three
              peers. We experimentally varied the distribution of this social
              information, systematically manipulating its variance (extent of
              agreement among peers) and its skewness (peer judgements
              clustering either near or far from the participant's judgement).
              As expected, higher variance among peers reduced their impact on
              behaviour. Importantly, observing a single peer confirming a
              participant's own judgement markedly decreased the influence of
              other-more distant-peers. Second, we develop a framework for
              modelling the cognitive processes underlying the integration of
              disparate social information, combining Bayesian updating with
              simple heuristics. Our model accurately accounts for observed
              adjustment strategies and reveals that people particularly heed
              social information that confirms personal judgements. Moreover,
              the model exposes strong inter-individual differences in strategy
              use. Third, using simulations, we explore the possible
              implications of the observed strategies for belief updating.
              These simulations show how confirmation-based weighting can
              hamper the influence of disparate social information, exacerbate
              filter bubble effects and deepen group polarization. Overall, our
              results clarify what aspects of the social environment are, and
              are not, conducive to changing people's minds.",

  abstract = "Social learning can help individuals to efficiently acquire
              knowledge and skills. In the classroom, social learning often
              takes place in structured settings in which peers help, support,
              and tutor each other. Several protocols have been developed to
              make peer-assisted learning (PAL) more efficient. However, little
              attention has been devoted to how the transfer of knowledge is
              shaped by the social relationship between peers, and their
              relative positions in the social network. To address this gap, we
              combined social network analysis with an experimental social
              learning task, in which pupils (N = 135; aged 11-19) could use
              social information from their peers to improve their performance.
              We show that pupils' tendencies to use social information
              substantially decrease with the peer's distance in the social
              network. This effect is mediated by subjective closeness: pupils
              report feeling much closer to their friends than to their
              non-friends, and closeness strongly enhances social learning. Our
              results further show that, above and beyond these effects of
              network distance, social information use increases with the
              peer's social status (network centrality) and perceived
              smartness. Our results provide empirical evidence in a
              naturalistic setting for the role of specific network attributes
              in shaping pupils' willingness to learn from their peers. These
              findings illustrate the value of a social network approach for
              understanding knowledge transfer in the classroom and can be used
              to structure more effective peer learning. (PsycInfo Database

  abstract    = "Humans live in a fundamentally social world. The behavior and
                 judgments from friends, colleagues, television hosts and
                 social media feeds drive our purchase decisions, induce
                 lifestyle changes, and determine voting preferences. People
                 tend to be more sensitive to social information when they are
                 unsure about their own beliefs, and assign more weight to
                 social information when its source is highly confident.
                 However, little is known about the relative impact of the
                 confidence of self and others on social information use, and
                 how they jointly shape social transmission. Here we show with
                 two incentivized decision-making experiments that the
                 confidence of others had a substantially larger impact on
                 social information use than people's own confidence. In tasks
                 involving perceptual decisions (experiment 1; N=203) and US
                 election predictions (experiment 2; N=213), participants could
                 adjust their initial judgments upon observing judgments of
                 others and were rewarded for accuracy. Adjustments were most
                 strongly impacted by the confidence of others, particularly
                 when participants' own confidence was low. Furthermore,
                 confidence also affected adjustment heuristics: confident
                 others prompted participants to compromise more often, rather
                 than to stick with their initial judgments. Our results
                 highlight how giving more weight on the confidence of others
                 can be a double-edged sword: it can accelerate learning when
                 confidence is related to accuracy, but it also leaves people
                 vulnerable to sources who confidently share misinformation.",

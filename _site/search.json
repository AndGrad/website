You can find some examples below.\n\n  Charities Game\n  \n    \n   \n    A version of the classic Dictator Game, with a real-life twist. Partcipants decide to keep a resource (1 euro) or share with a real Charity, multiple times. In this version, they see the choices of their real classroom peers. The identity of the peer can be experimentally manipulated to measure influence of different types of peers.\n  \n\n\n  Predict the elections\n  \n    \n   \n    A version of the classic Dictator Game, with a real-life twist.

    "text": "In my PhD I study social learning strategies in adolescents and adults. I look at what type of peers (close friends, popular, smart) are most influential within classrooms, what types of social cues (confidence, expertise, majority) people use when they look at others’ opinions, and weather following others is beneficial or not. The main outcomes of my projects are:\n\nexperimental evidence that people learn more from those socially close to them in their social network (Gradassi et al., 2023)\nhow confidence of self and others shapes social learning (Gradassi et al., 2022);\nhow high-status peers can boost adolescents prosocial behaviour in classrooms (in prep.)\nhow adolescents learn to use social cues of confidence and expertise to improve their decisions over development (in prep.)\nexperimental evidence that sensitivity to peer influence in adolescents is helpful to explore uncertain environments (in progress).\n\n\n\nSelected publications\nGradassi, A., Slagter, S.

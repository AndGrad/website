    "text": "During my PhD, I (co-)designed and adapted several behavioral tasks. Below are some examples of tasks for which I wrote most of the code.\n\n  Charities Game\n  \n    \n   \n    A version of the classic Dictator Game, with a real-life twist. Partcipants decide to keep a resource (1 euro) or share with a real Charity, multiple times. In this version, they see the choices of their real classroom peers. The identity of the peer can be experimentally manipulated to measure influence of different types of peers.\n  \n\n\n  Predict the elections\n  \n    \n   \n    A realistic estimation game with a social component. In October 2020, participants were asked to predict the result of the upcoming US elections. Before submitting their final prediction, they could see the (real) prediction of a previous participant in the experiment. We studied how much people adjusted as a function of the political identity and confidence of the player they were matched with.\n  \n\n  Find the gem\n  \n    \n   \n    A social version of the multi-armed bandit task, designed to measure how people solve explore/exploit problems. This version of the task was inspired by  Wu et al., 2018, and designed to test some predictions from  Ciranka & van den Bos, 2021. Participans have to explore an 8x8 grid in 25 clicks and maximise total points. Some options earn  points, some lose. Some environments contain highly rewarding options, or \"gems\". These are up to 5x valuable than the second best options, thus worth finding. In the social version, players see the choices of a previous participant, who could help (or hinder) exploration."

    "text": "In my PhD I study social learning strategies in adolescents and adults. I look at what type of peers (close friends, popular, smart) are most influential within classrooms, what types of social cues (confidence, expertise, majority) people use when they look at others’ opinions, and wether following others is beneficial or not. The main outcomes of my projects are:\n\nStudents in classrooms learn more from those socially close to them in their social network, those who are considered smart, or popular (Gradassi et al., 2023).\nConfident people are followed more, even when there is no information on whether they are right or not (Gradassi et al., 2022).\nHigh-status teenagers can boost prosocial behaviour of their classmates (in prep.).\nAdolescents learn to use social cues of confidence and expertise to improve their decisions over development (in prep.).\nSensitivity to peer influence in adolescents is helpful to explore uncertain environments (in progress).\n\n\n\nSelected publications\nGradassi, A., Slagter, S.

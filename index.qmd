I'm Andrea, a researcher interested in human social behavior. I like to [design experiments](/experiments.qmd) to study [how people learn from others.](/projects.qmd)

I am finishing up my PhD in Psychology at the university of Amsterdam in the [Connected Minds Lab](https://connectedmindslab.net/), **and will be soon looking for a job**.\
